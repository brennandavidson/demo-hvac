# Client Intake Process Instructions

When the user asks to process a client intake, run these 5 phases in order:

1. **intake-phase-1-research** - Read intake form, research competitors
2. **intake-phase-2-content** - Write website copy, blog posts, SEO content
3. **intake-phase-3-config** - Build site.config.json, copy assets
4. **intake-phase-4-images** - Process images via Freepik API (CRITICAL - do not skip)
5. **intake-phase-5-verify** - Test build, verify pages

Each phase is a separate skill. Complete each phase fully before moving to the next.

⚠️ **Phase 4 is CRITICAL.** You MUST call the Freepik API for blog and city images. Do NOT use Unsplash URLs.
