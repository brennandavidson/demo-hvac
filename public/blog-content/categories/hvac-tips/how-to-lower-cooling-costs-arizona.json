  "content": "<h2>Beat the Heat Without Breaking the Bank</h2><p>Arizona homeowners know the struggle: summer electricity bills that can easily exceed $300-400 per month. With temperatures regularly hitting 110-115 degrees, your air conditioner works overtime just to keep your home bearable. The good news is that strategic changes can significantly reduce your cooling costs.</p><h3>Optimize Your Thermostat Settings</h3><p>The Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat to 78 degrees when you're home and higher when you're away. Every degree lower than 78 increases energy use by 3-4%.</p><ul><li>Install a programmable or smart thermostat</li><li>Raise temperature 7-10 degrees while at work</li><li>Avoid drastic temperature swings that overwork your system</li></ul><h2>Maintain Your HVAC System</h2><p>A well-maintained air conditioner operates more efficiently and uses less energy. Neglecting maintenance can reduce efficiency by 5% or more each year.</p><h3>Change Filters Regularly</h3><p>In Arizona's dusty environment, filters clog faster than in other climates. Check your filter monthly during summer and replace it every 1-2 months. A dirty filter restricts airflow and forces your system to work harder.</p><h3>Schedule Professional Tune-Ups</h3><p>Annual professional maintenance catches small problems before they become expensive repairs. A tune-up includes cleaning coils, checking refrigerant levels, and ensuring all components operate correctly.</p><ul><li>Clean evaporator and condenser coils improve heat transfer</li><li>Proper refrigerant charge ensures optimal cooling</li><li>Lubricated moving parts reduce energy consumption</li></ul><h2>Reduce Heat Gain in Your Home</h2><p>The less heat that enters your home, the less your AC has to remove. Simple changes can make a significant difference.</p><h3>Window Treatments and Shading</h3><p>South and west-facing windows receive the most intense sunlight. Use blinds, curtains, or solar screens to block heat before it enters your home.</p><h3>Seal Air Leaks</h3><p>Gaps around windows, doors, and ductwork allow cool air to escape and hot air to enter. Weatherstripping and caulking are inexpensive solutions that provide immediate results.</p><ul><li>Check for drafts around windows and doors</li><li>Inspect ductwork in unconditioned spaces</li><li>Seal gaps around electrical outlets and pipes</li></ul><h2>Consider System Upgrades</h2><p>If your AC is more than 10 years old, upgrading to a modern high-efficiency unit can reduce cooling costs by 20-40%. Look for systems with a high SEER rating—the higher the number, the more efficient the unit.</p>",
