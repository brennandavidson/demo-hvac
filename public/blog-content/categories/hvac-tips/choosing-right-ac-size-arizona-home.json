  "content": "<h2>Why AC Size Matters in Arizona</h2><p>When it comes to air conditioning in Arizona, bigger isn't always better. An oversized unit cools too quickly, cycling on and off frequently without properly dehumidifying. An undersized unit runs constantly, struggling to maintain comfortable temperatures during peak heat. Getting the size right is crucial for comfort, efficiency, and equipment longevity.</p><h3>Understanding BTUs and Tonnage</h3><p>Air conditioner capacity is measured in BTUs (British Thermal Units) or tons. One ton equals 12,000 BTUs per hour. Most residential systems range from 1.5 to 5 tons, depending on home size and other factors.</p><ul><li>1 ton = 12,000 BTUs per hour of cooling</li><li>Average Arizona homes need 3-5 tons</li><li>Proper sizing requires professional calculation</li></ul><h2>Factors That Affect AC Sizing</h2><p>Square footage is just the starting point. A proper load calculation considers many variables specific to your home and location.</p><h3>Home Construction</h3><p>The age and construction of your home significantly impact cooling needs. Newer homes with better insulation require less cooling capacity than older homes with poor insulation.</p><h3>Window Orientation and Size</h3><p>South and west-facing windows receive intense Arizona sun. Large windows or sliding glass doors increase heat gain substantially, requiring additional cooling capacity.</p><ul><li>Window quality and UV coating</li><li>Amount of shade from trees or structures</li><li>Use of window treatments and solar screens</li></ul><h3>Ceiling Height and Layout</h3><p>High ceilings mean more air volume to cool. Open floor plans may circulate air differently than homes with many separate rooms.</p><h2>The Manual J Calculation</h2><p>Professional HVAC contractors use Manual J calculations to determine proper sizing. This industry-standard method accounts for all variables affecting your cooling load.</p><h3>What the Calculation Includes</h3><p>A proper Manual J considers your home's specific characteristics rather than relying on simple square-footage rules of thumb.</p><ul><li>Geographic location and climate data</li><li>Insulation levels in walls, attic, and floors</li><li>Window specifications and orientation</li><li>Number of occupants and heat-generating appliances</li><li>Ductwork design and condition</li></ul><h2>Avoid Common Sizing Mistakes</h2><p>Many homeowners and even some contractors make sizing errors that lead to problems down the road. The most common mistake is using simple rules like \"one ton per 500 square feet\" without considering Arizona's extreme climate and your home's specific needs.</p><h3>Work With Qualified Professionals</h3><p>Always choose an HVAC contractor who performs proper load calculations. A reputable company takes the time to assess your home thoroughly before recommending equipment size.</p>",
